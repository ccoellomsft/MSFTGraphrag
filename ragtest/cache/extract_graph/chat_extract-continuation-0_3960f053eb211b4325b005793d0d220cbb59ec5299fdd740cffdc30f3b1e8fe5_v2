'Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.'\n\n'It's Christmas Day!' said Scrooge to himself. 'I haven't missed it. The\nSpirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.\nOf course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!'\n\n'Hallo!' returned the boy.\n\n'Do you know the poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?'\nScrooge inquired.\n\n'I should hope I did,' replied the lad.\n\n'An intelligent boy!' said Scrooge. 'A remarkable boy! Do you know\nwhether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--Not\nthe little prize turkey: the big one?'\n\n'What! the one as big as me?' returned the boy.\n\n'What a delightful boy!' said Scrooge. 'It's a pleasure to talk to him.\nYes, my buck!'\n\n'It's hanging there now,' replied the boy.\n\n'Is it?' said Scrooge. 'Go and buy it.'\n\n'Walk-ER!' exclaimed the boy.\n\n'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to\nbring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.\nCome back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him\nin less than five minutes, and I'll give you half-a-crown!'\n\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger\nwho could have got a shot off half as fast.\n\n'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,\nand splitting with a laugh. 'He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the\nsize of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to\nBob's will be!'\n\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write\nit he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open the street-door, ready\nfor the coming of the poulterer's man. As he stood there, waiting his\narrival, the knocker caught his eye.\n\n'I shall love it as long as I live!' cried Scrooge, patting it with his\nhand. 'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it\nhas in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!--Here's the turkey. Hallo!\nWhoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!'\n\nIt _was_ a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.\nHe would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of\nsealing-wax.\n\n'Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,' said Scrooge. 'You\nmust have a cab.'\n\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid\nfor the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\nchuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by\nthe chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and\nchuckled till he cried.\n\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;\nand shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are\nat it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a\npiece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.\n\nHe dressed himself 'all in his best,' and at last got out into the\nstreets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them\nwith the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind\nhim, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so\nirresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured\nfellows said, 'Good-morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!' And Scrooge\nsaid often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,\nthose were the blithest in his ears.\n\nHe had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly\ngentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and\nsaid, 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?' It sent a pang across his heart\nto think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but\nhe knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n\n'My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old\ngentleman by both his hands, 'how do you do? I hope you succeeded\nyesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!'\n\n'Mr. Scrooge?'\n\n'Yes,' said Scrooge. 'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant\nto you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness----'\nHere Scrooge whispered in his ear.\n\n'Lord bless me!' cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.\n'My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?'\n\n'If you please,' said Scrooge. 'Not a farthing less. A great many\nback-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that\nfavour?'\n\n'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him, 'I don't know\nwhat to say to such munifi----'\n\n'Don't say anything\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Ebenezer Scrooge is the central character of the story, a businessman who undergoes a transformation and embraces the spirit of Christmas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOB CRATCHIT<|>PERSON<|>Bob Cratchit is Scrooge's underpaid and overworked clerk, who is the father of Tiny Tim)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TINY TIM<|>PERSON<|>Tiny Tim is Bob Cratchit's young son, known for his frail health and optimistic outlook)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMAS DAY<|>EVENT<|>Christmas Day is the holiday being celebrated, marking Scrooge's newfound generosity and joy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAMDEN TOWN<|>GEO<|>Camden Town is the location where Bob Cratchit and his family live)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POULTERER<|>PERSON<|>The poulterer is the shopkeeper selling the prize turkey that Scrooge purchases for the Cratchit family)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORTLY GENTLEMAN<|>PERSON<|>The portly gentleman is a charitable figure who had previously solicited donations from Scrooge for the poor)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>BOB CRATCHIT<|>Scrooge decides to send a large turkey to Bob Cratchit as a gesture of kindness and generosity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>TINY TIM<|>Scrooge's actions indirectly benefit Tiny Tim, whose health and happiness are central to the Cratchit family's struggles<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>CHRISTMAS DAY<|>Scrooge embraces the spirit of Christmas Day, marking his transformation from miserly to generous<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>CAMDEN TOWN<|>Scrooge sends the turkey to Camden Town, where the Cratchit family resides<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>POULTERER<|>Scrooge purchases the prize turkey from the poulterer to gift to the Cratchit family<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBENEZER SCROOGE<|>PORTLY GENTLEMAN<|>Scrooge apologizes to the portly gentleman and offers a generous donation to make amends for his previous behavior<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOB CRATCHIT<|>TINY TIM<|>Bob Cratchit is Tiny Tim's father and deeply cares for his well-being<|>9)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
