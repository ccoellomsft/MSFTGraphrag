Marley's Ghost appears to Scrooge with a grave purpose: to deliver a warning and confront Scrooge's disbelief in the supernatural. The ghost informs Scrooge of the dire consequences of his selfish and unkind ways, cautioning him about the fate that awaits him if he does not change his behavior. \n\nMarley's Ghost reveals that Scrooge will soon be visited by three spirits, each with a critical role in guiding him toward redemption. These supernatural visitations are intended to influence Scrooge's thoughts and compel him to reflect on his past, present, and future actions.
